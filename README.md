# Discord cache recovery tool

This tool is designed to help recover lost media files from the Discord cache folder.

## Description

The Discord Cache Recovery Tool is a simple application that reads through the Discord cache folder and organizes the media files into respective folders based on extension. It is highly useful for lost images or gifs that are still somewhere visible on your discord client, however their source has disappeared. E.g.
gifs that are still visible in your favourite gifs tab but the links to them lead to an empty/deleted page.

## Usage

1. Download the exe file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Azmekk/discord-cache-recovery-tool/releases/latest).
2. Place it in a folder where you want to dump all the files
3. Run the executable file.

## Help

## FAQ

### Q: Is this a virus?
A: No, but you can and should still run it through virustotal for your own safety as you shold do with any other sketchy exe file.

### Q: Can this flood my disk?
A: No, the app is designed to recognize already recovered files. You can run it to your heart's content.

### Q: I wasn't able to find the image/gif I was trying to recover.
A: The app will only recover whatever is still available in the discord cache. It can only retrieve items if they have not been deleted from it.

### Q: Can it look for a specific file?
A: It would be too complicated to map cache to the respective files in the discord client so it will simply dump all the media for you to find. You can probably narrow the search by searching for the specific flie in the proper folder based on the file's extension. E.g gif.
